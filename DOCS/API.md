## TUTORIAL
    - Step 1: Set Up the Backend 

    Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project:

    Initialize Node.js Application

    Install Express.js, Mongoose (to interact with MongoDB), and other required dependencies:

    Create Express.js Server

    Create a file named server.js and set up an Express.js server:

        const express = require('express');
        const app = express();
        const mongoose = require('mongoose');
        const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
        const cors = require('cors');

        // Add middleware
        app.use(bodyParser.json());
        app.use(cors());

        // Connect to MongoDB
        mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/movieapp', {
        useNewUrlParser: true,
        useUnifiedTopology: true,
        });

        const db = mongoose.connection;
        db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'MongoDB connection error:'));
        db.once('open', () => {
        console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
        });

        const port = process.env.PORT || 3001;

        app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
        });

    Set Up Routes

    Create a routes directory and define your API routes in separate files.

    Create Models

    Define your MongoDB models for movies, users, or any other data you want to store.

    - Step 2: Set Up the Frontend (React)

    Create a React App

    Navigate to the client directory and install Axios (for making API requests) and any other dependencies you may need:

    Create React components for your application, such as MovieList, MovieDetail, and AddMovie.

    Set Up Routing

    onfigure routing using react-router-dom to navigate between different views.

    Fetch Data from the API

    Use Axios to fetch data from your backend API and display it in your React components.

    - Step 3: Connect the Backend and Frontend
    Configure CORS

    In your Express.js server, configure CORS to allow requests from your frontend:

        const cors = require('cors');

        // Add middleware
        app.use(cors());
        API Endpoints

    Create API endpoints in your Express.js routes to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for movies.

    Axios Requests

    In your React components, make Axios requests to the backend API endpoints to interact with your MongoDB database.

    - Step 4: Styling and UI
    Add CSS or Styling Framework

    Style your React components using CSS or a styling framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI.

    Create a User-Friendly Interface

    Design a user-friendly interface for your movie collection app with a clean and intuitive layout.



## CONCEPTUAL
    - An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. It defines how different software components should communicate, what data they can access, and what operations they can perform.
